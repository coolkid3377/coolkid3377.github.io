*This is a digest from a PIIE [article](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/when-regulators-miss-signals-failing-bank).*

## Summary of theÂ article:  
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the second-largest commercial bank failure in US history, exposed weaknesses in prudential supervision and bank resolution in the United States. The Barr report analyzes supervisory failures that led to SVB's collapse but overlooks the inability to recognize and address SVB's probable failure through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as resolution authority. Current supervisory processes have proven inadequate, and there is a need to strengthen the lead supervisor's role in recognizing the need for resolution. Three significant US bank failures within weeks have caused losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund and highlighted the importance of learning from these shortcomings. The US system, where the FDIC receives supervisory information but is not the lead supervisor, should have the ideal institutional architecture, but it failed to prevent SVB's collapse.

## Background on the banking regulation:  
Banking regulation aims to ensure the stability, integrity, and efficiency of the financial system by setting rules, standards, and guidelines for banks and financial institutions. It involves monitoring, supervising, and enforcing these rules to mitigate risks and prevent financial crises. Regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States are responsible for overseeing banking activities and maintaining public confidence in the system.
Key aspects of banking regulation include capital adequacy, which requires banks to hold sufficient capital to absorb losses; liquidity management, ensuring banks can meet short-term obligations; and risk management, aimed at minimizing banks' exposure to variousrisks like credit, market, and operational risks. Additionally, regulations address consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and combating the financing of terrorism. The Basel Accords, a series of international banking regulations developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, provide a global framework for harmonizing banking rules and promoting financial stability. Post-financial crisis reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the US, introduced further regulations to strengthen the financial system and protect consumers.
