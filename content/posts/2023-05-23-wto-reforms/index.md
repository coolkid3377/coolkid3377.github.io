title: "WTO Reforms Needed Now"
summary: "We often see countries involved in bilateral trade disagreement. Not being able to resolve the disagreement via the WTO mechanisms, they typically end up in trade sanction against each other. What goes wrong with the WTO, which is designed to resolve the trade issues among countries?"

Trade is the life blood of the global economy. [WTO](https://www.wto.org/) is the organization designed to resolve the trade issues among different countries. Recently, Alan Wolff in the [Peterson Institute](https://www.piie.com/) wrote an [article](https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/can-world-trade-organization-be-saved-should-it), arguing the need for the WTO reforms to resolve the challenges the organization is facing now. His key points are:

1. The WTO has been largely successful in promoting world trade growth but faces many challenges. It needs to adapt to issues like climate change, pandemics, and technological changes.

2. The WTO has several shortcomings including its inability to negotiate new trade agreements, the breakdown of its dispute settlement mechanism, lack of an executive branch, and limited intelligence gathering.

3. The WTO’s deficits stem from the tension between sovereignty and international cooperation, leadership vacuum, original design flaws, and the accidental way it was conceived during the Uruguay Round.

4. The multilateral trading system aims to promote efficiency through division of labor, act as a peace project, govern trade through global rules, provide nondiscrimination, transparency, and enforceability of commitments.

5. The author suggests restoring the WTO’s negotiating function, making dispute settlement binding again, and recognizing the executive functions to address the key challenges of the 21st century like climate change, pandemics, the digital economy, and subsidies.

6. The WTO is worth reforming because it provides a functioning international trading system with rules that can adapt to global issues like pandemics, climate change, and new technologies. Failure to revitalize the WTO risks slower global economic growth.

If you are interested, you can read the original article to gain more insight. Here I will provide some background on the issues he mentioned:

1. The WTO has struggled to negotiate new multilateral trade agreements due to the consensus-based decision making and unwillingness of members to compromise sovereignty. Achieving consensus among 164 members with diverse interests has proven nearly impossible.

2. The WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism has broken down due to the U.S. blocking new judge appointments to the Appellate Body, the highest court in the WTO’s three-stage dispute system. The U.S. sees the court as overstepping, but without resolution, the WTO loses its ability to enforce rules and settle disputes.

3. The WTO lacks an executive branch to set strategic direction and propose policy changes. The Secretariat has limited autonomy and the Director-General’s role is more managerial. Power rests with members, but they struggle to lead on new issues.

4. The WTO has limited intelligence gathering ability since it relies on self-reporting by members. It lacks resources and a mandate to investigate issues like national subsidies, currency manipulation, or IP violations that could undermine global trade.

5. The WTO was created through negotiations of the Uruguay Round to reduce trade barriers, but not designed for current issues like digital trade, SOEs, or climate change. Its mandate and institutional set-up has not evolved sufficiently to address these new areas.

6. There is an inherent tension between countries wanting to cooperate on trade but also protect national sovereignty. This hampers the WTO’s ability to take bold action or enforce its rules stringently. There is little shared vision of the WTO’s role in global governance.

7. A leadership vacuum exists since members pursue narrow self-interests rather than shared goals. Major players like the U.S. and EU have stepped back leaving a void, while China is disinclined to lead as a “developing” member. Director-General attempts to lead reforms have had little success.
